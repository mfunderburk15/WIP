        <h2>My Home Town</h2>
        <p>
            I lived in a shoebox size apartment (about 200 square ft.) in the town Tana.
            Not known for anything, this area by train was about 30 minutes away from Yokohama station, and 45 minutes away from Shibuya Station.
            It was nice living there as it was quiet, peaceful, and relaxing.  There was not any of the hustle from surrounding major cities.
            Tana has mostly family owned businesses like motorcycle repair, restaurants, and dry cleaners.  But there was a popular and maybe  familiar name, Denny's.

        <p>
            I remember how weird it was to see Denny's at my home station.  Unfamiliar with Tana, I went to Denny's the next morning.
            Assuming I could find waffles with bacon and sausage, a sudden shock came looking at the menu.  My Eyes were met with <a href="https://www.dennys.jp/language/en/" target="_blank">traditional Japanese breakfasts</a> that I have never eaten before.
            Settling with an Omlette Rice plate with a side of yogurt and a latte, I was met with the best breakfast of my life.  This is where I realized, Japan was the start of an amazing chapter in my life.
